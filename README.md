# Readme for JavaScript Course repo

Every folder inside this repo represents one chapter in the course.


In every folder there are 2 subfolders 
### 1) 'starter' - this is mine code that I started coding by being given some starter code by the instructor, but now looks (should look) like 'final' folder. 
	
### 2) 'final' - this folder is the final version that the instructor got after finishing lecturing that particular lecture.
	
	
	
At the time of writing this readme the course is completely finished and all 'starter' folders should look like 'final' ones.
